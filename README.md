# content_guard
I have noticed that some people transfer the thumbnails, names, and content intact to "other audio-visual platforms" for profit, and even a few of them do not indicate the source at all. I think this is a very serious infringement of the YouTuber himself, so I want to scan these contents through this spontaneous project. I hereby declare that this project is only aimed at the group of people who stole the creative content, not "other audio-visual platforms".
